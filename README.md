# Raspberry Pi Demos

This is a non-offcial branch of the project written by me Toby Gore.

I have seen a handful of typos and smaller improvements to the software that some may find handy too.

Almost all the demos in this repo require a Raspberry Pi with a SenseHat.

A lot of the basic demos are based off of the [Raspberry Pi Sense Hat demos](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat).

## Basic Demos

These demos are a good hands on way to play around with some python code and immediatly see results using the LED matrix on the SenseHat.

- 01 Hello world
- 02 Hello Tim
- 03 Colour Sensor
- 04 Matrix Control with Joystick
- 05 Pressure reading
- 06 Humidity reading
- 07 Temperature reading
- 08 Blink random colours
- 09 Blink RAINBOW colours!
